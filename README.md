# FizzBuzzApi

Task: Write a server application, which generates the Fizz buzz sequence with the following restrictions:
- The application must have a single endpoint.

- The return value should be the Fizz buzz sequence in JSON. Please design a meaningful data
structure.
- Implement tests. The type of testing (unit test, integration test, etc.) is your decision.

- When you make design decisions, please document your reasoning behind your choice.
- Please document how to build, test, and run the application.
